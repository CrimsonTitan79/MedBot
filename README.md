# MedBot

MedBot is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for head nurses to manage patients’ and medical 
staff’s personal information, and schedule appointments between them. By utilising text-based commands 
instead of traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) based navigation, MedBot can allow head nurses
to get their management tasks done quicker and more efficiently.
